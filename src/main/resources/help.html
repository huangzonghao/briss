		page is merged to a cluster if it has the same size and is either even
		or odd.</li>

		pointer into the rectangle, press the right mouse button and click
		"Delete rectangle"
	</li>
	<li>You can <b>move</b> crop rectangles around by clicking and
		holding the left mousebutton in a crop rectangle!

		the selected crop rectangles and paste them by pressing ctrl+v.</li>
	<li>Various other self describing actions are available through the <span style="font-family: monospace">Action-</span> menu.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Command line usage</h3>
<p>
	If you prefer command line and trust the basic automatic detection
	algorithm use it this way (can be batched!):<br />
<pre>
java -jar briss-0.0.13.jar -s [SOURCEFILE] [-d [DESTINATIONFILE]]
</pre>
Example:
<pre>
java -jar briss-0.0.13.jar -s dogeatdog.pdf -d dogcrop.pdf
java -jar briss-0.0.13.jar -s dogeatdog.pdf 
</pre>
<p>the second line will crop the file into
<pre>dogeatdog_cropped.pdf</pre>
